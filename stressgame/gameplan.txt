what is the difference between AI and PVP?

no ai loop
no hashset 2
keylistener event for fliponpiles
win loss frames


DONE
back button now goes back to the main menu instead of quitting the whole program

Made the "select game mode" screen initalise either an AI game frame or pvp gameframe 

Made it so that the new game button from win / lose screen will prompt us to choose gamemode 

implemented cardstacking for player 2 

IN PVP, changed implementation for fliponpiles, now both players to hold down their stress buttons
