After downloading this file in a directory, 
open src/App.java in VSCode and just compile and run! Cards should init on a frame
(if it still shows blank screen after 10 sec just close the frame and rerun)



How to play:
Keys A, S, D, F, refer to the 4 cards infront of you respectively from left to right
Keys W, E refer to the two center piles.

You may play any of your 4 cards onto either pile, as long as 
the value of your card is one more or one less than the value of the card on top of the pile.

To play a card on one of the piles, press a card key and a pile key concurrently
Example: (F + E) plays the right-most card to the right pile.
